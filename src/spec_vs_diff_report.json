  "summary": "Diff adds an activity configuration layer and multiple interactive learning-mode UIs, and updates LearningModeRunPage to render mode-specific interactive content with optional chapter context. However, the diff summary does not provide sufficient evidence that all 20 predefined modeIds are supported by configurations and renderers, nor does it fully show the required non-chapter landing state/CTA details.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "The experience must work for all 20 predefined modeIds in frontend/src/data/learningModes.ts (each /learning-modes/$modeId renders mode-specific UI, not a generic placeholder).",
      "reason": "The diff shows an activity config map and renderer with 8 activity types, but the provided (truncated) config snippet only clearly includes a handful of modeIds (e.g., flashcards, quiz, mcq, fill-blanks, match). There is no explicit evidence in the diff summary that all 20 modeIds from learningModes.ts have corresponding entries in learningModeActivities.ts and thus render mode-specific UI.",

      "requirement": "When chapter context is missing, show a usable mode landing state plus a working 'Choose a Chapter' button linking to /chapters, and clearly indicate chapter selection is required for chapter-specific practice.",
      "reason": "LearningModeRunPage shows a conditional block for '!chapterContext' but the relevant section is truncated, so the diff summary does not confirm the presence of a 'Choose a Chapter' button linking to '/chapters' or the exact required messaging/state.",
